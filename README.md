# Small Signal Stability Analysis Project for Multi-Machine Power Systems

## Description

This repository contains a Python project designed to analyze small signal stability in multi-machine power systems. The project is structured into three main modules, each focusing on a specific phase of the analysis.

### Modules

1. **Calculation of Nodal Admittance Matrix (Y bus)**
   - This module calculates the nodal admittance matrix necessary for stability analysis.

2. **Power Flow Calculation using Newton-Raphson Method**
   - Implementation of the Newton-Raphson method for power flow calculation in the multi-machine power system.

3. **Determination of Oscillation Modes and Associated Graphs**
   - In this module, the system's oscillation modes are determined, and graphs are generated for visualization.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, among others.

### Programming Structure

The project follows a purely object-oriented structure, facilitating modularity and code extension.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
